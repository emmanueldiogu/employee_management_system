# Project 3 - Database Integration
## Real Employee Management System
## Objective:
This project aims to integrate a database into a web application and manage data effectively. Using SQLite, a lightweight and easy-to-use database, we design a database schema, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and integrate it with a simple web application. The focus is on developing a functional prototype, integrating various concepts such as the MVC (Model-View-Controller) method to separate concerns, server-client interaction, and code organization with an emphasis on implementing advanced features, troubleshooting, and refining code for efficiency and performance.

## Functionalities:
- [CREATE] HR enters their data into the employee list when new staff are employed.
- [RETRIEVE] HR can retrieve the employee list or a single employeeâ€™s data.
- [UPDATE] HR can update employee data.
- [DELETE] HR can delete employees from the list.
- [SEARCH] HR can search the database to retrieve an employee record.
